      <description>About me&amp;nbsp;¶ I&amp;rsquo;m a final year Computer Science student, studying at BITS Pilani(Goa), India. I&amp;rsquo;m broadly interested in Human-Centered AI applications and their ethical implications for individuals and society.
I am currently pursuing my undergraduate thesis at MIT Media Lab, with the Fluid Interfaces Group. I am working as a part of the Project PAL, where we are leveraging Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning for behaviour change interventions to assist users with habit formation.</description>

      <description>Human-in-the-loop, Interpretable, Sample-efficient RL for Behaviour Change Interventions (PAL) (2020)&amp;nbsp;¶ Supervisor - Mina Khan
Members - Advait Rane, P Srivatsa
I am working on the Project PAL in the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT Media Lab for my undergraduate thesis.
Habit formation can be supported with computer-generated interventions. However, for these interventions to be helpful they should be personalised and context-specific. For a healthy interaction with the user the system should learn to adapt to the user fast, and the user should be able to understand and control its behaviour.</description>

      <description>Synchronisation in Neural Mass Models (2020)&amp;nbsp;¶ Supervisor - Dr. Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya
Members - Advait Rane, Pranav Mahajan, Swapna Sasi
I am working in the BINN Lab, BITS Goa to study the synchronisation between neural populations in the Neural Mass Model of the Thalamocortical Visual Pathway.
A Neural Mass Model represents each neuronal population as a single neuron. The connectivity between these neurons is determined by the synapse weights. I worked on implementing a Neural Mass Model of the Thalamocortical Visual Pathway in the brain in Python as well as MATLAB.</description>

      <description>Automated Product Placement using GANs (2019)&amp;nbsp;¶ Supervisor - Srinivasan Govindaraj
Members - Advait Rane, Krut Patel
I worked as an ML intern at Happiest Minds Technologies, Bangalore to automate contextual product placement for advertising in videos.
The aim of this project was to automate the placement of certain products into video content post-production, so as to fit in with the context of the scene. To achieve this, we identified a similar object in the video and replaced it with the product to be advertised.</description>

      <description>GCNs to detect fraudulent transactions in a Bitcoin transaction graph (2019)&amp;nbsp;¶ This was a personal project I undertook in September 2019. The aim was to classify licit and illicit Bitcoin transactions using Graph Convolutional Networks. I implemented the methods described in the paper- &amp;ldquo;Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin: Experimenting with Graph Convolutional Networks for Financial Forensics&amp;rdquo; by Weber et. al.
The dataset used is provided by Elliptic. It is a dataset of a graph network of Bitcoin transactions with handcrafted features.</description>

      <description>Visual Perception of the Colour Spectrum (2019)&amp;nbsp;¶ Supervisors - Mayur Jartarkar, Veeky Baths
I worked in the BITS Goa Cognitive Neuroscience Lab to study the human perception of the colour spectrum by classifying EEG data.
I initially worked on creating an android app to display colours through a VR headset to completely flush the subject&amp;rsquo;s field of vision. This would eliminate any distracting visuals from confounding the data. The display alternated between three colours at a time, either red-green-blue or cyan-magenta-yellow.</description>

      <description>Mosquitoes&amp;nbsp;¶ I haven’t been bitten by these mosquitoes in a while.
These mosquitoes which buzz noisily near your ear,
And hover ominously above your head,
Which make you break that comfortable position you had assumed,
To scratch your ankle, to rid it of the annoying itch.
These mosquitoes which come out only at night,
Like our deepest secrets,
Which pour out of our crevices,
Into the deceptive safety of the dark,</description>

      <description>Crush&amp;nbsp;¶ This gravity
won&amp;rsquo;t leave me be
as I fall over and over again
I escape only momentarily
to be pulled back by my memories
and I fall almost willingly
under the trance of my
ill-conceived notions of serendipity.
The scabs on my knees won&amp;rsquo;t heal
because I keep picking them
forcing them to bear
the blows that my heart deflects
and they open up and
the blood that pours out is a brilliant lurid red</description>

      <description>Gloom&amp;nbsp;¶ The gloom is contagious.
Lethargy crawls languorously,
Descending from the lugubrious skies.
Like shapeless blobs of a viscous liquid,
In the absence of gravity,
It rains before the rains.
It preys on the hapless mind,
Drowning the industrious cries,
In the indolent fluid.
The vagabond mind drifts into,
A frustrated apathy towards the present.
It falls into,
The murky puddles of the past.
Throws questions of morality,
And of practicality,</description>

      <description>The Beach&amp;nbsp;¶ There&amp;rsquo;s water. There&amp;rsquo;s the massive expanse of waves and ripples, like an all-encompassing Juggernaut, throwing itself around until it crumbles into the sand.
There&amp;rsquo;s the sand. The mixture of crushed rocks, broken bottles, stubbed cigarettes and dichotomies in which you can bury yourself comfortably.
The wind. The wanton wind which runs along your skin, eloping with all your worries, leaving you inebriated with peace.
The reflections. The imitations of reality in broken pieces of glass that could cut your foot as they embellish the sand, trying to capture the truth but only really lying.</description>
