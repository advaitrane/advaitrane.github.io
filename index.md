## Advait Rane

I'm a final year Computer Science student at BITS Goa, India. 
I'm broadly interested in Human-Centred AI applications and their ethical implications for individuals and society.

### About Me

 I am currently pursuing my undergraduate thesis at MIT Media Lab, with the Fluid Interfaces Group. I am working as a part of the Project PAL, where we are leveraging Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning for behaviour change interventions to assist users with habit formation.
