<meta name="twitter:description" content="Gloom&nbsp;¶ The gloom is contagious.
Lethargy crawls languorously,
Descending from the lugubrious skies.
Like shapeless blobs of a viscous liquid,
In the absence of gravity,
It rains before the rains.
It preys on the hapless mind,
Drowning the industrious cries,
In the indolent fluid.
The vagabond mind drifts into,
A frustrated apathy towards the present.
It falls into,
The murky puddles of the past.
Throws questions of morality,
And of practicality,"/>

<p>The gloom is contagious.<br>
Lethargy crawls languorously,<br>
Descending from the lugubrious skies.<br>
Like shapeless blobs of a viscous liquid,<br>
In the absence of gravity,<br>
It rains before the rains.<br>
It preys on the hapless mind,<br>
Drowning the industrious cries,<br>
In the indolent fluid.</p>
<p>The vagabond mind drifts into,<br>
A frustrated apathy towards the present.<br>
It falls into,<br>
The murky puddles of the past.<br>
Throws questions of morality,<br>
And of practicality,<br>
Enrobed in tatters,<br>
Of a blanket meant for two.</p>
<p>Unanswerable questions,<br>
Of wrongdoings that can’t be forgiven.<br>
Of owed emotions that can’t be felt.<br>
Of truths that can’t be justified.<br>
Of fragile promises, <br>
Whispered through torn lips,<br>
Flashing quivering smiles.<br>
Of the meaning of the time,<br>
Spent texting, at night,<br>
On a phone I’ve lost.<br>
Of the meanings of the feelings,<br>
Between the exhilarating anxiety,<br>
And the crippling sorrow,<br>
Of the meanings of the sounds,<br>
Of our fluttering hearts,<br>
Which pretended to be words.<br>
Of the meanings which were meant,<br>
But can’t be explained.<br>
Of the feelings which were felt,<br>
But now are dead.</p>
<p>And I fall,<br>
Into the wrinkles of a bed-sheet,<br>
That has a mild odour of my sweat,<br>
But none of the tears that I never wept.<br>
The sheets need to be changed.</p>
<p>And I fall,<br>
Into the dilapidated ruins of the past,<br>
Where the serpentine lanes,<br>
Ending in culs de sac,<br>
Are lit by,<br>
The flickering lamps of the speckled heart.<br>
Hoping that someday,<br>
The dawn will bring,<br>
The eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.</p>
