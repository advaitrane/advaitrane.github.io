forcing them to bear the blows that my heart deflects and they open up and the blood that pours out is a brilliant lurid red and I feel the rush of adrenaline and enjoy the ephemeral high until reality comes along and sews my wounds shut and the blood that flows back is cold and blue and seeps into every crevice of my soul and I mourn in the frigidity."/>

<p>This gravity <br>
won&rsquo;t leave me be <br>
as I fall over and over again <br>
I escape only momentarily <br>
to be pulled back by my memories <br>
and I fall almost willingly <br>
under the trance of my <br>
ill-conceived notions of serendipity.</p>
<p>The scabs on my knees won&rsquo;t heal <br>
because I keep picking them<br>
forcing them to bear <br>
the blows that my heart deflects <br>
and they open up and <br>
the blood that pours out is a brilliant lurid red <br>
and I feel the rush of adrenaline <br>
and enjoy the ephemeral high <br>
until reality comes along and <br>
sews my wounds shut and <br>
the blood that flows back is cold and blue <br>
and seeps into every crevice of my soul and <br>
I mourn in the frigidity.</p>
<p>I know <br>
I shan&rsquo;t ever find what a seek <br>
but I can&rsquo;t stop hoping for <br>
a tiny mistake in the folds of history <br>
to change the course of your life and mine <br>
for time to wrap around itself <br>
until I find <br>
the right words to say and smile to smile and thoughts to think <br>
but instead <br>
time coils it&rsquo;s cold blooded body around my memory <br>
and sinks its fangs into me <br>
and the poison that trickles down is your smile in the moonlit night <br>
I shall never get to see again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s late and I must sleep <br>
it&rsquo;s late and I must let <br>
time empty my mind of the thoughts <br>
that seem benign until the cancer spreads <br>
and every idea of mine <br>
is tinged with this terrible treacherous tenacious hope <br>
that is like a chocolate <br>
with the aftertaste of vomit <br>
for they say time heals everything <br>
but they never said &hellip; <br>
