To scratch your ankle, to rid it of the annoying itch.

Like our deepest secrets,
Which pour out of our crevices,
Into the deceptive safety of the dark,"/>

<p>I haven’t been bitten by these mosquitoes in a while.<br>
These mosquitoes which buzz noisily near your ear,<br>
And hover ominously above your head,<br>
Which make you break that comfortable position you had assumed,<br>
To scratch your ankle, to rid it of the annoying itch.</p>
<p>These mosquitoes which come out only at night,<br>
Like our deepest secrets,<br>
Which pour out of our crevices,<br>
Into the deceptive safety of the dark,<br>
Under the blanket of a thick silence,<br>
And buzz noisily in our heads,<br>
And hover ominously near the ears,<br>
Of the people we trust,<br>
Waiting for the judgement to be passed,<br>
And the gates of heaven or hell to open.<br>
For the comfort you have assumed with those people,<br>
To be shattered or reinforced.</p>
<p>I haven’t been bitten by these mosquitoes in a while.<br>
These mosquitoes have preferences.<br>
Which suck blood from one while leaving the other in peace,<br>
Which make one of the two people want to leave,<br>
While the other is left confused as to what did displease.</p>
<p>These mosquitoes which come out only at night,<br>
When we share the darkness,<br>
And we share our warmth with each other,<br>
Until there is no warmth left inside one of us.<br>
And with that last bit of warmth siphoned off,<br>
The darkness starts closing in,<br>
It starts to suffocate the light inside,<br>
But nothing can be shared with one light snuffed out.<br>
And so the two become ones, and try to reignite the light inside alone.<br>
The darkness attacks selectively,<br>
But pain attacks universally.</p>
<p>I haven’t been bitten by these mosquitoes in a while.<br>
These mosquitoes which cause pain,<br>
And still like Donne’s flea, are the only memories that remain,<br>
Of the times our blood mingled together.<br>
When our blood was hot, and promises were only words.<br>
These mosquitoes don’t remind me of the pain,<br>
But only of the warmth which we shared.<br>
They bring out the romantic in me,<br>
As I remember, not the regrets, but the times that were good.</p>
<p>So as I sit on the cold floor,<br>
In the darkness of this night,<br>
With a friend and an opened bottle,<br>
Of emotions and memories,<br>
I let these mosquitoes bite me,<br>
Because the sting is conducive to life.</p>
